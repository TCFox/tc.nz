After my first utterly failed attempt at trying to build a website for myself based off an [HTML5 Up!](https://html5up.net/) template and some half-arsed hosting on a Windows Server box that promptly fell over, this domain spent well over a year helpfully [displaying advertising for Internet Information Services](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20161009043440/tc.nz) instead of actually being useful. Which is a shame, seeing as it is such an epic domain name!

So, I finally got off my arse and set up this website. I wanted to do something a bit different, something that was low maintenance to both maintain and update with content. My recent fascination with Markdown led me to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby-based static content generator used extensively by [GitHub](https://github.com/) to support their [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature.

So, what better way to kick off this (hopefully more stable!) iteration of my new site than to share with you how I built it?
